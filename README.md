# Movie-Rating-Prediction-Project
The Movie Rating Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie based on a variety of features, such as genre, director, and actors. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.
